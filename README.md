# Wanderley Ferreira de Albuquerque
## PHP Developer

I'm a PHP Developer, passionate about my profession, a very happy husband and father, and above all a curious person who loves to read, play video games and do outdoor activities (when this is possible). I am constantly learning and evolving and I try to apply this to my daily life, and especially to my work.
