# Wanderley Ferreira de Albuquerque
## PHP Developer

I'm a PHP Developer, passionate about my profession, a very happy husband and father, and above all a curious person who loves to read, play video games and do outdoor activities (when this is possible). I am constantly learning and evolving and I try to apply this to my daily life, and especially to my work. 

## Experience

#### Business Analyst / PHP Developer at WanderleyFA.COM

I'm n a new challenge at this moment is remote work in a Supplementary Pension Fund, I can dedicate myself to learn more about how to digitize business processes, using tools and programming languages.
In this project in addition to working with an incredible team, I am having the opportunity to improve my business analysis and task management skills.
In the project I am using Bitrix24 as the connection point between the physical processes and their digital counterparts, and in my particular, I use PHP as a language to develop the Bitrix24 can't do.

#### Project leader at WanderleyFA.COM

Since I founded WanderleyFA.Com, I provide development services, software implementation monitoring and consulting services for the acquisition of software services for small and medium companies. I have always worked together with the different people and sectors of each of the companies to deliver products and services that suit the current reality of the companies, making the value applied to the company already felt in the first weeks of partnership.
